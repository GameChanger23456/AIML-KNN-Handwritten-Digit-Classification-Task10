# AIML-KNN-Handwritten-Digit-Classification-Task10
This project builds a KNN model to classify handwritten digits using the Scikit-learn digits dataset. Images are scaled, split into train and test sets, and evaluated across multiple K values. Accuracy comparison, confusion matrix, and sample predictions demonstrate distance-based learning and optimal K selection with visual insights. Clear
